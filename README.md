## Little bit about me :raised_hand:
Hi, my name is Valacor. I'm currently doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist for application development. My passion is programming and cyber security. Besides that, I like to read new articles about IT related stuff.
When I'm not hanging out infront of my computer to discover the secrets of new technologies, programming languages and frameworks, I enjoy hanging out with friends, watching movies and series or try to understand the mysteries of human communication
